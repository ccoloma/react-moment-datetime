Want to contribute? You are awesome, thanks! Please, first read this:

### Code reviews
All submissions require review. We use Github pull requests for this purpose.

Your patch should adhere to these guidelines:

* Keep the same [coding style](#coding-style)
* Please include tests. Pull requests that do not include tests will not be accepted
* `npm test` should pass

## Coding Style

We use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) for basics and encourage you
to install its plugin on your text editor of choice.

The only hard-line rule is that the code should look uniform. We loosely follow
the [Airbnb JS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
